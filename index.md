The MDRS 228 crew is an international crew selected by the [Mars Society](https://www.marssociety.org/). Our team will travel to the [Mars Desert Research Station](https://mdrs.marssociety.org/about-the-mdrs/) this year to help put humans on Mars. We are engineers, artists, sociologists, astronomers, biologists, journalists, and physicians, who hail from all walks of life and eight nations. But most of all, we are explorers. Enjoy our sizzle reel below and [learn more about our mission!](mission.md)

Please note: Our mission was originally set to begin in Apr 2020, but we postponed it to now begin in Sep 2021 due to COVID-19.
