Crew journalist Stuart Hughes will be testing lightweight broadcast equipment for use in remote and extreme locations. He hopes to broadcast live from our mission for [BBC TV](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c40rjmqdwr7t/television) and radio programmes using satellite internet and to gather material using mini cameras and a drone to report on the work of MDRS to a worldwide audience.
